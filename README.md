## 🎮 How to Play

### The Basics

Your shop runs on a simple loop:

1. **Buy card packs** from distributors
2. **Open packs** to see what you pull
3. **Display cards** in your shop cases
4. **Wait for customers** to browse
5. **Haggle** (or don't) to close the sale
6. **Profit** and reinvest in more stock and upgrades

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Tab** | Open/Close Inventory |
| **M** | Toggle Shop Editor Mode |
| **Space** | Pause / Resume |
| **1 – 4** | Set Game Speed (1×, 2×, 4×) |
| **Esc** | Open Menu / Close Panels |
| **Mouse** | Interact with customers, UI, and shop layout |

### Time & Schedule

- **Shop Hours:** 8 AM – 10 PM
- **Real-time ratio:** ~24 real minutes = 1 in-game day
- **Peak hours:** Lunch (12–2 PM) and after work (5–7 PM) bring more foot traffic

Adjust game speed anytime with the number keys — crank it up during slow mornings or pause to plan your next move.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Know Your Customers

Not everyone who walks through your door is the same. Learning their habits will help you price and negotiate smarter.

| Customer | Budget | Personality |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Casual Collector** | $5 – $30 | Friendly, browses commons and uncommons |
| **Serious Collector** | $50 – $500 | Hunts rares, expects fair deals |
| **Card Investor** | $100 – $1,000 | Big spender, very impatient |
| **Young Collector** | $1 – $10 | Patient kid just starting out |
| **Card Expert** | $30 – $200 | Picky about sets, knows prices |
| **Bargain Hunter** | Varies | *Will* try to haggle — every time |

---

## 💬 Haggling

Some customers will counter your price. When they do, you'll enter a negotiation:

- **Accept** their offer to close the deal quickly
- **Counter** with a higher price (watch their mood!)
- **Reject** and they may walk away

Keep an eye on the mood indicator — push too hard and you'll lose the sale entirely.

## 📈 Progression

As you sell cards and satisfy customers, your **Reputation** grows. Higher reputation unlocks:

- More customer traffic
- Rare and ultra-rare card access
- Premium shop furniture
- VIP collectors with deep pockets
- New card sets

There are **10 reputation ranks** to climb, from *Newcomer* all the way to *Card King*.

### Achievements

Hidden and visible achievements reward milestones like:

- Your first sale
- Selling 100 / 1,000 cards
- Earning $10K / $100K / $1M in revenue
- Successfully haggling repeatedly

## 💡 Tips for New Shopkeepers

1. **Display your cards** — Customers can only buy what they see on shelves and cases.
2. **Stock variety matters** — Different collectors want different rarities.
3. **Watch for Bargain Hunters** — They always haggle; price accordingly.
4. **Hire staff** when queues get long — Clerks speed up checkout.
5. **Hunt the Ancient Dragon** — A secret-rarity card worth $100. Good luck pulling one.
